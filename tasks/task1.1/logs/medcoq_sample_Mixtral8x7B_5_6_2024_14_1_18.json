        "query": "What is the significance of the QRS complex being negative in aVR lead?",
        "answer": "A negative QRS complex in aVR lead suggests that the heart's electrical axis is directed away from lead aVR, which can indicate certain cardiac conditions such as left anterior fascicular block or inferior myocardial infarction. However, it's important to interpret this finding in the context of other ECG findings and symptoms for accurate diagnosis."

        "query": "What is the location of the mean vector or axis of depolarization based on the provided electrocardiogram (ECG) findings?",
        "answer": "The mean vector or axis of depolarization cannot be directly determined from an ECG tracing. However, the frontal plane QRS axis can be estimated using lead I, II, and III or aVL, aVF, and V1."
