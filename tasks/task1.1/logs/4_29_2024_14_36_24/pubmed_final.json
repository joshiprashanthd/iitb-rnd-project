        "query": "Does the enteral feeding advancement affect short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants?",
        "answer": "Yes, the advancement of enteral feeding in very low birth weight infants can have a positive impact on their short-term outcomes. A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2017 found that early achievement of full enteral feeds in very low birth weight infants was associated with better short-term outcomes, including reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, less need for postnatal steroids, and shorter hospital stays. The promotion of early and progressive enteral feeding not only supports normal gut physiology and immune function but also reduces the dependency on intravenous nutrition, which carries risks such as infection and liver disease. Therefore, careful advancement of enteral feeds, under the guidance of a healthcare professional, can significantly improve the overall health and wellbeing of very low birth weight infants in the short term."

        "query": "Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?",
        "answer": "Yes, lung ischemia and reperfusion can have an impact on coronary flow. Ischemia-reperfusion injury in the lungs can lead to systemic inflammation, which can affect the coronary circulation. This occurs due to the release of inflammatory mediators during the reperfusion phase, which can cause vasoconstriction in the coronary arteries, reducing coronary flow. Additionally, the production of reactive oxygen species during this process can further exacerbate coronary endothelial dysfunction, leading to impaired coronary flow. This can ultimately result in myocardial injury, contributing to the development of conditions such as myocardial stunning or even infarction in severe cases. Therefore, it is crucial to manage lung ischemia-reperfusion injury effectively to prevent any adverse effects on coronary flow and subsequent myocardial damage."

        "query": "Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?",
        "answer": "Amblyopia, also known as \"lazy eye,\" is a neurodevelopmental vision disorder that typically begins in childhood. It's characterized by reduced vision in one eye, which can't be improved with glasses or contact lenses alone. The good news is that amblyopia treatment can often improve vision, especially if it's detected and treated early in life. The main treatment for amblyopia is patching or atropine eye drops, which work by forcing the brain to use the weaker eye. However, if amblyopia is left untreated or if treatment is started too late, it can lead to permanent visual loss in the affected eye. This is because the brain learns to ignore the signals from the weaker eye, leading to a decrease in the development and maintenance of the neural connections involved in vision. Therefore, early detection and treatment of amblyopia are crucial to prevent permanent vision loss."
