        "answer": "BACH1 primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor, although it can also exhibit activator functions under certain conditions. It typically represses gene expression by binding to Maf recognition elements (MAREs) and forming heterodimers with small Maf proteins, which then recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other corepressors to inhibit transcription. However, BACH1 can also act as a transcriptional activator by forming complexes with other transcription factors, such as NFE2L1, and recruiting histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to enhance transcription."
