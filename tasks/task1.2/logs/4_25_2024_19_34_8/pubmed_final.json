A faster advancement of feeding has been associated with reduced risks of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a severe gastrointestinal disease, and improved growth rates. However, it's important to balance this with considerations of individual infant tolerance and potential for feeding intolerance."}, "115": {"query": "Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?", "answer": "Yes, lung ischemia and reperfusion can have an impact on coronary flow. This is because the lung and heart share a close anatomical and functional relationship. During lung ischemia and reperfusion, inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species are released, which can cause systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. These factors can affect the coronary circulation, leading to changes in coronary flow. Additionally, lung ischemia and reperfusion can also cause imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, which can further impact coronary flow. However, the specific nature of these impacts (increase or decrease in flow) can vary and may depend on several factors, including the severity and duration of ischemia, the presence of any underlying heart conditions, and the individual's overall health status."}, "26": {"query": "Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?", "answer": "No, visual loss due to amblyopia is not necessarily permanent. With early detection and appropriate treatment, including correcting any underlying refractive errors, patching, or vision therapy, visual acuity can often be improved in amblyopic eyes, especially in children. However, if left untreated, visual loss can become permanent as the brain learns to ignore inputs from the weaker eye."}, "760": {"query": "Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?", "answer": "Yes, ESC (Electronic Stability Control) can change the way we drive by improving vehicle stability and control, particularly in critical situations like slippery roads or sharp turns. It helps prevent the vehicle from skidding or sliding off its intended path, making driving safer and more secure."}, "282": {"query": "Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?", "answer": "Yes, both ascites volume and anthropometric measurements should be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrhotics. Ascites volume can help assess the severity of cirrhosis and guide treatment decisions, while anthropometric measurements such as muscle mass and fat distribution can provide information about nutritional status and overall health. This information can help healthcare providers make informed decisions about patient care and prognosis."}}
