        "query": "Does the enteral feeding advancement affect short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants?",
        "answer": "**Answer:** Yes.\n\n**Reasoning:** A meta-analysis of 15 studies published in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2019 found that enteral feeding advancement, which involves gradually increasing the volume and frequency of enteral feedings in very low birth weight infants, was associated with improved short-term outcomes, including increased weight gain, improved linear growth, and decreased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. This is because enteral feeding advancement allows for more effective nutrient delivery, improved gut maturation, and reduced reliance on parenteral nutrition, which can lead to better overall health outcomes in these vulnerable infants."

        "query": "Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?",
        "answer": "**Answer: Yes**\n\nLung ischemia and reperfusion have been shown to have a significant impact on coronary flow. During lung ischemia, there is a decrease in cardiac output due to reduced venous return, which subsequently reduces coronary blood flow. This decrease in coronary flow can lead to a reduction in oxygen delivery to the myocardium, potentially causing ischemia.\n\nWhen reperfusion occurs, the increased blood flow returning from the lungs can lead to an increase in coronary flow, but this may not immediately compensate for the previous decrease in flow during ischemia. The reperfusion injury can also cause further oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue damage, which can further compromise coronary flow.\n\nTherefore, lung ischemia and reperfusion can have a complex impact on coronary flow, leading to changes in myocardial perfusion, oxygenation, and ultimately, cardiac function."

        "query": "Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?",
        "answer": "No.\n\nAmblyopia, also known as lazy eye, can cause permanent visual loss if left untreated or inadequately treated, especially in children. This is because the brain has a critical period for developing normal binocular vision, which is typically until around 7 years of age. If visual stimulation from one eye is weak, the brain may favor the other eye, leading to permanent suppression of vision in the affected eye. However, if treatment starts early, it can still improve vision in some cases, especially in younger children. In adults, amblyopia can still be treated, but the prognosis for full recovery is less favorable due to the brain's reduced ability to reorganize itself after the critical period."

        "query": "Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?",
        "answer": "Yes.\n\nESC (Electronic Stability Control) can indeed change the way we drive by improving vehicle stability, reducing skidding, and enhancing overall safety on the road. It does this by detecting when a vehicle is losing traction or sliding, and then automatically applying the brakes to individual wheels or adjusting engine power to help correct the vehicle's direction of travel. This technology has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of accidents, especially in slippery or unpredictable road conditions, which can force drivers to make sudden corrections. By providing increased stability and control, ESC can encourage more confident and cautious driving habits, potentially leading to a safer driving experience overall."

        "query": "Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?",
        "answer": "**Yes**\n\nAscites volume and anthropometric measurements should be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics because they are essential indicators of liver disease severity, fluid status, and nutritional status. Ascites volume can help assess the degree of liver cirrhosis, while anthropometric measurements, such as mid-arm circumference, can indicate protein malnutrition, which is common in cirrhotic patients, especially those with malnutrition-related complications like ascites. Estimating these parameters allows healthcare providers to monitor disease progression, assess response to treatment, and adjust therapy accordingly."
