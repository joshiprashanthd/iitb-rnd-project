        "query": "Does the enteral feeding advancement affect short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants?",
        "answer": "Yes, enteral feeding advancement in very low birth weight infants can affect short-term outcomes. A faster advancement of enteral feeding has been associated with a shorter duration of parenteral nutrition, which can reduce the risk of associated complications such as infection, cholestasis, and liver disease. However, it's important to balance the rate of feeding advancement with the infant's tolerance to prevent feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, and other gastrointestinal complications. Therefore, a careful, individualized approach is necessary for each infant."

        "query": "Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?",
        "answer": "Yes, lung ischemia and reperfusion can have an impact on coronary flow. This occurs due to the systemic inflammatory response triggered by the lung ischemia and reperfusion, which can cause vasoconstriction and reduce coronary blood flow. This response involves the release of various proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and other mediators that can affect the coronary circulation. In addition, lung ischemia and reperfusion can lead to changes in the autonomic nervous system, which can further impact coronary flow by modulating vascular tone. However, it's important to note that the magnitude of this impact can vary depending on the severity of the lung injury and individual patient characteristics."

        "query": "Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?",
        "answer": "No, visual loss due to amblyopia is not necessarily permanent. With proper treatment, including correcting any underlying refractive errors, patching the stronger eye to strengthen the weaker one, and/or vision therapy, some improvement in visual acuity can often be achieved, especially in children if treatment is initiated at an early age. However, the extent of improvement can vary and may not result in fully normalized vision."

        "query": "Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?",
        "answer": "Yes, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) can change the way we drive, as it helps to improve vehicle stability and reduce the risk of skidding, thereby enhancing safety and potentially influencing driving behavior. ESC systems automatically apply individual brakes to help control oversteering or understeering during turns, allowing drivers to maintain better control over their vehicles. This can lead to more confident and safer driving, ultimately changing the way we drive."

        "query": "Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?",
        "answer": "Yes, both ascites volume and anthropometric measurements should be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrhotic patients. Ascites volume assessment helps in determining the prognosis, guiding therapy, and monitoring response to treatment in cirrhotic patients. Anthropometric measurements, such as body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure, can provide important information about the patient's nutritional status, muscle wasting, and cardiovascular function, which are critical in managing alcoholic cirrhotic patients. Therefore, regular assessment of these parameters can aid in early detection of complications, optimizing treatment plans, and improving overall patient outcomes."
