Define hyperosmia and its meaning in the context of medical terminology.\n2. Discuss how hyperosmia manifests as a heightened sense of smell.\n3. Explain under what conditions hyperosmia might occur and its potential causes.", "answer": "1. Hyperosmia is a term used in medical terminology to describe an increased acuteness of the sense of smell. It goes beyond the normal ability to detect and discriminate odors, and can result in olfactory fatigue or discomfort due to overwhelming smells.\n2. As a heightened sense of smell, hyperosmia can manifest as an increased sensitivity to odors that are normally faint or even undetectable to most people. This heightened sensitivity can lead to discomfort or annoyance, especially when exposed to strong or pungent smells.\n3. Hyperosmia might occur under various conditions and can have several potential causes. It can be a genetic trait, where individuals inherit an increased sensitivity to smells from their parents. Additionally, certain medical conditions such as migraines, depression, and Parkinson's disease can cause hyperosmia as a symptom. Exposure to certain chemicals or toxic substances, such as those found in cleaning products, can also lead to hyperosmia. Furthermore, hormonal changes during pregnancy can also result in an increased sensitivity to smells."}, "461": {"query": "Which tumor suppressor is referred to as \"the guardian of the genome\"?", "outline": "1. Introduce the concept of tumor suppressors.\n2. Identify the specific tumor suppressor referred to as \"the guardian of the genome.\"", "answer": "1. Tumor suppressors are genes that encode proteins responsible for preventing the uncontrolled cell growth that leads to cancer. They play crucial roles in regulating the cell cycle, repairing DNA damage, and initiating apoptosis, or programmed cell death, when cells become too damaged or dangerous to survive.\n\n2. The specific tumor suppressor referred to as \"the guardian of the genome\" is p53. This protein detects and responds to various forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage, oncogene activation, and hypoxia, or lack of oxygen. Upon activation, p53 can either halt cell division until damage is repaired or trigger apoptosis if the damage is too severe or irreparable, thus preventing the propagation of potentially cancerous cells."}, "138": {"query": "What is the target protein of the drug Idelalisib?", "outline": "1.
